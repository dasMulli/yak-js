### Speed up client development using plug&play JavaScript WebSocket servers

This tool is for developing, rapid prototyping, testing, integrating and simulating WebSocket communication.

YAKjs is a [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) like tool for WebSockets.   

## Get started

Get started in less than 55 seconds. If you have already installed [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

**Download**

Go to the **[latest release package 0.3.0](https://github.com/cobuChris/yak-js/releases)**.
Download zip package and extract it.


**Start the server**

Go to yakjs-server and use ``` node yakjs-server.js ``` or the startup scripts.
This will stat the yakjs-server with default service port 8790.


**Start the client**

Go to yakjs-ui and open the index.html (latest browser generation recommended)
It will automatically try to connect to the yakjs-server service port ws://localhost:8790


**Start an instance**

On the service user interface, start pre configured 'echo' instance.
Now your 'echo' WebSocket server instance is running and ready. 
You can test it with any WebSocket client (e.g.: [websocket.org](http://www.websocket.org/echo.html))
