# YAKjs Store

The YAKjs has a simple key/value store integrated. To get access to within a plugin use the require parameter.

```javascript
'use strict';

/**
 * @type {!JsonStore}
 */
const store = require('../common/store');

```

To get a value from the store

```javascript
store.get('itemKey');
```

To add/update a value

```javascript
store.set('itemKey', 'This is my data');
```

The store value has to be always a string. If you want to store an object then serialize it with JSON.stringify before.
